What if a nation decided it wanted to make things again. Not just design them. Not just import them. Make them here, with our own hands, our own people, our own talent.[1]

It sounds simple. Build the plant. Order the machines. Cut the ribbon.  
But then reality walks in.  
A factory is only as strong as the people who stand inside it. And for more than thirty years, we pushed people out of the skilled trades pipeline and into the college pipeline. We told students a path through a university was success, and a path through a trade school was settling.[2]

Now America is paying for that choice.  
Our shortages are not sudden. They are the predictable result of years of messaging, systems, and decisions that produced more degrees than the job market needs, and fewer skilled workers than the country depends on.

## How the Pipeline Tilted  

### College Enrollment Rose. Technical Training Fell.

**Chart 1. Indexed Trend: College Enrollment vs High School CTE Coursetaking, 1992 to 2019**[3]

![Indexed Trend: College Enrollment vs High School CTE Coursetaking, 1992–2019](/assets/images/makers-chart1-college-vs-cte.png)

The picture is simple. The college line rises above its 1992 level. The CTE line drifts down.

#### Table 1. College vs CTE Over Time  

| Year | College enrollment (%) | Index 1992 = 100 | Avg CTE credits | Index 1992 = 100 |
|------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1992 | 61.9 | 100.0 | 3.13 | 100.0 |
| 2004 | 66.7 | 107.8 | 2.90 | 92.7 |
| 2013 | 65.9 | 106.5 | 2.60 | 83.1 |
| 2019 | 66.2 | 106.9 | 2.83 | 90.4 |

College goes up. Skilled training goes down.  
The system got the result it was designed for.

We did not let society quietly decide. We nudged students with systems, counselors, policies, and expectations until we had more young people in debt and fewer young people who can bend conduit, pull wire, weld steel, repair HVAC systems, or operate machine tools.

## What Society Actually Needs  

The labor market tells the truth.[4]  
It reflects the needs of the people who live in the country.

- Health care for an aging population  
- Skilled trades for housing, infrastructure, and energy  
- Cybersecurity and cloud for a digital society  
- Logistics for a consuming nation  

Most of these roles do not require four year degrees. They require training, certification, and hands on skill.

#### Table 2. Sectors and Their Best Education Pathways  

| Sector | Reality of demand | Best pathway |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Health care support | Expanding fast | Certificates, associate degrees |
| Construction and trades | Nationwide shortages | Apprenticeships, trade schools |
| Cyber and cloud | High growth | Certifications plus experience |
| Logistics and transport | Persistent demand | Licensing and on the job training |
| Engineering and advanced fields | Stable demand | College degrees |

Add it together and the ideal national workforce pipeline looks like this.

**Chart 2. Ideal vs Current Workforce Preparation Mix**

#### Table 3. Ideal vs Current Preparation Mix  

| Pathway | Ideal share (based on needs) | Current share of high school graduates |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| College pathway | 35 to 40 percent | 60 to 65 percent |
| Trades and technical | 60 to 65 percent | 35 to 40 percent |

We flipped the pyramid.  
We produced more degrees than we had degree jobs, and fewer skilled workers than we had skilled jobs.

## The Money Question: Where the Payoff Really Is  

The country promoted one pathway.  
But the payoff depends on the field, not the institution.[5]

#### Table 4. Return on Investment Snapshot  

| Pathway | Typical cost | Median pay | Ten year payoff summary |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Low return bachelor degree | 40k to 120k | 45k to 55k | Often modest, sometimes negative |
| High return bachelor degree | 60k to 140k | 80k to 115k | Strong if completed |
| Skilled trades | 5k to 20k | 55k to 85k | Strong, low debt, early earnings |
| Cyber and IT cert pathways | 1k to 8k | 55k to 110k | Very strong, degree optional |

Trades and certifications often outperform many degrees with less risk.  
High return degrees still matter. The problem is that we built an entire culture on the promise that any degree would do.
