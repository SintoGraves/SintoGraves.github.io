What if a nation decided it wanted to make things again. Not just design them. Not just import them. Make them here, with our own hands, our own people, our own talent.[1]

It sounds simple. Build the plant. Order the machines. Cut the ribbon.  
But then reality walks in.  
A factory is only as strong as the people who stand inside it. And for more than thirty years, we pushed people out of the skilled trades pipeline and into the college pipeline. We told students a path through a university was success, and a path through a trade school was settling.[2]

Now America is paying for that choice.  
Our shortages are not sudden. They are the predictable result of years of messaging, systems, and decisions that produced more degrees than the job market needs, and fewer skilled workers than the country depends on.

## How the Pipeline Tilted  

### College Enrollment Rose. Technical Training Fell.

**Chart 1. Indexed Trend: College Enrollment vs High School CTE Coursetaking, 1992 to 2019**[3]

![Indexed Trend: College Enrollment vs High School CTE Coursetaking, 1992–2019](/assets/images/makers-chart1-college-vs-cte.png)

The picture is simple. The college line rises above its 1992 level. The CTE line drifts down.

#### Table 1. College vs CTE Over Time  

| Year | College enrollment (%) | Index 1992 = 100 | Avg CTE credits | Index 1992 = 100 |
|------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1992 | 61.9 | 100.0 | 3.13 | 100.0 |
| 2004 | 66.7 | 107.8 | 2.90 | 92.7 |
| 2013 | 65.9 | 106.5 | 2.60 | 83.1 |
| 2019 | 66.2 | 106.9 | 2.83 | 90.4 |

College goes up. Skilled training goes down.  
The system got the result it was designed for.

We did not let society quietly decide. We nudged students with systems, counselors, policies, and expectations until we had more young people in debt and fewer young people who can bend conduit, pull wire, weld steel, repair HVAC systems, or operate machine tools.

## What Society Actually Needs  

The labor market tells the truth.[4]  
It reflects the needs of the people who live in the country.

- Health care for an aging population  
- Skilled trades for housing, infrastructure, and energy  
- Cybersecurity and cloud for a digital society  
- Logistics for a consuming nation  

Most of these roles do not require four year degrees. They require training, certification, and hands on skill.

#### Table 2. Sectors and Their Best Education Pathways  

| Sector | Reality of demand | Best pathway |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Health care support | Expanding fast | Certificates, associate degrees |
| Construction and trades | Nationwide shortages | Apprenticeships, trade schools |
| Cyber and cloud | High growth | Certifications plus experience |
| Logistics and transport | Persistent demand | Licensing and on the job training |
| Engineering and advanced fields | Stable demand | College degrees |

Add it together and the ideal national workforce pipeline looks like this.

**Chart 2. Ideal vs Current Workforce Preparation Mix**

![Ideal vs Current Workforce Preparation Mix](/assets/images/makers-chart2-ideal-vs-current.png)

#### Table 3. Ideal vs Current Preparation Mix  

| Pathway | Ideal share (based on needs) | Current share of high school graduates |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| College pathway | 35 to 40 percent | 60 to 65 percent |
| Trades and technical | 60 to 65 percent | 35 to 40 percent |

We flipped the pyramid.  
We produced more degrees than we had degree jobs, and fewer skilled workers than we had skilled jobs.

## The Money Question: Where the Payoff Really Is  

The country promoted one pathway.  
But the payoff depends on the field, not the institution.[5]

#### Table 4. Return on Investment Snapshot  

| Pathway | Typical cost | Median pay | Ten year payoff summary |
|---------|--------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Low return bachelor degree | 40k to 120k | 45k to 55k | Often modest, sometimes negative |
| High return bachelor degree | 60k to 140k | 80k to 115k | Strong if completed |
| Skilled trades | 5k to 20k | 55k to 85k | Strong, low debt, early earnings |
| Cyber and IT cert pathways | 1k to 8k | 55k to 110k | Very strong, degree optional |

Trades and certifications often outperform many degrees with less risk.  
High return degrees still matter. The problem is that we built an entire culture on the promise that any degree would do.

## Sidebar. How People Are Wired  
### Why Interests Should Guide Career Choices  

People are not identical. Psychologists describe work interests using the RIASEC model.[6]

- **Realistic.** Hands on, tools, building, fixing.  
- **Investigative.** Analysis and complex problem solving.  
- **Artistic.** Creating and designing.  
- **Social.** Helping and teaching.  
- **Enterprising.** Leading and persuading.  
- **Conventional.** Detail and structure.  

Most people are a blend. Many “college graduates” are actually Realistic at heart. They enjoy woodworking, building, repairing, and creating. They burn out in purely desk based roles.

Research on person–environment fit finds that people are most satisfied when their interests match their work, and they struggle when they do not.[6] A Realistic person trapped in a purely abstract job can feel drained, even when they are good at the tasks. A Social person in an isolated role can feel cut off. An Artistic person in a rigid environment can feel boxed in.

This is not failure. It is wiring.

The labor market reinforces this. The United States has millions of jobs in Realistic environments. Construction. Electrical. HVAC. Welding. Automotive. Industrial maintenance. Renewable energy installation. Cyber and network work that is hands on with hardware. These fields are not backup plans. They are the backbone of the country.

The mismatch happens when the education system nudges people into pathways that do not fit who they are. A student who loves building things may be pushed toward college simply because that is seen as the upward path. A student who is happiest working with tools and materials may be told those jobs are somehow less.

Before choosing a direction, people should take their interests seriously. Not every path requires a four year degree, and not every person is wired for four years of abstraction. Some are wired for creation, problem solving, and physical skill. Those interests are strengths, not limitations. They point to careers that are in demand, pay well, and matter to the real world.

The country needs thinkers. It also needs makers. The key is knowing which one you are before you pick a lane.

## The Real Timeline To Rebuild the Workforce  

Training takes time. Experience takes time. Skill takes time.  
Here is what a real reconstruction looks like.

**Chart 3. Timeline to Rebuild the Skilled Workforce**

![Timeline to Rebuild the Skilled Workforce](/assets/images/makers-chart3-timeline.png)

### The phases  

- **Awareness shift. Years 0 to 2.**  
  Parents, schools, and students need to see trades as equal to academic paths. National messaging, local examples, and employer involvement all play a role.

- **Pipeline rebuild. Years 2 to 6.**  
  Community colleges expand technical seats. Apprenticeship programs grow. High school CTE programs get funded instead of cut. Employers start sponsoring training instead of just complaining about shortages.

- **Workforce maturity. Years 6 to 12.**  
  An electrician, machinist, HVAC tech, welder, robotics operator, or semiconductor technician does not become fully confident in one year. Skill takes miles, not minutes. The early cohorts are gaining depth while new cohorts line up behind them.

Because the phases overlap, a serious national push takes about seven to twelve years before the country has a skilled workforce that matches its industrial ambitions.

## Sidebar. Why Skill Cannot Be Rushed  

Factories can be built with money.  
Skills can only be built with time.

- Electricians build judgment over thousands of hours.[7]  
- Welders gain consistency through repetition.  
- HVAC techs master systems by solving real problems.  
- Cyber analysts learn pattern recognition through real incidents.  

This is why reshoring is not just economic policy. It is human development policy. It is culture policy. You cannot microwave a workforce.

## In Closing  

America can make things again.  
The question is not whether the machines exist.  
The question is whether the people exist.

If we want a nation that builds, repairs, installs, operates, maintains, and manufactures at scale, then we must create a generation that sees value in doing those things.

We can make things in America.  
But first we must decide to make makers again.
