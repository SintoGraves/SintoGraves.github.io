# A Ballroom for the People Who Pay for It
### Reason Over Rhetoric — Oversight in Practice

> “The White House Ballroom will be a much-needed and exquisite addition to the East Wing, constructed at zero cost to the American taxpayer.”

## Opening Thought
While I was glad to learn that private donors are paying for the new White House ballroom, it did not take long to realize that the real cost will still reach the public.  Once completed, upkeep, utilities, maintenance, and security become permanent lines in the federal budget.

A larger space means more power, more cleaning, more systems to manage, and more people to staff and protect it.  The building itself may be privately funded, but the bill for operating it will arrive each year with the rest of the government’s expenses.

## Discussion Point

### Historic Use vs. New Space
Even in the most active administrations, the number of large-scale events has remained small.  The East Room and South Lawn tents have long been sufficient for those moments.

| President | Approx. Major Events (4-Year Term) | % of Term Days Used | Typical Location |
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--|
| Reagan | ~75 | 0.6 % | East Room / South Lawn |
| Clinton | ~40 | 0.3 % | East Room / Tents |
| G. W. Bush | ~20 | 0.1 % | South Lawn / Museums |
| Obama | ~25 | 0.2 % | East Room / Tents |
| Trump | ~5 | 0.03 % | South Lawn / East Room |
| Biden | ~15 | 0.1 % | East Room / Tents |

Average use across presidencies: **less than one percent of term days** [^2]

### Estimated New Annual Cost
Based on FY 2025 budget data for the Executive Residence (88 FTE, $15.6 million total) [^3],  a new 90 000 square-foot ballroom would add roughly **$3 – 4 million per year** in recurring operating cost.

| Expense Type | Estimated Annual Cost | Source |
|:--|--:|:--|
| Core Staff (≈ 12 FTE for upkeep and systems) | $ 1.7 M | EOP budget ratio |
| Utilities / HVAC / Power / Cleaning | $ 1.1 M | Facility load estimate |
| Security and Oversight | $ 0.5 M | Secret Service support |
| **Total Annual Increase** | **≈ $ 3.3 M – $ 3.5 M** | New recurring cost |

This equals roughly a **20 – 25 percent increase** in the current Executive Residence operating budget.

### Other Venues Already Available
Washington already offers secure federal sites that could host visiting dignitaries without expanding the White House footprint [^4].

| Venue | Approx. Size | Ownership | Common Federal Use |
|:--|--:|:--|:--|
| Walter E. Washington Convention Center | 52 000 sf ballroom | DC Gov / GSA | Inaugurals, summits |
| National Building Museum – Great Hall | 36 600 sf | Federal charter | Gala receptions |
| Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium | 8 000 sf main hall | GSA | Federal ceremonies |
| Smithsonian Kogod Courtyard | 28 000 sf | Smithsonian | State and press events |

Each of these venues already hosts secure, high-profile events.  The only thing the new ballroom adds is exclusivity inside the Executive Mansion.

## Bottom Line
Private construction may look like a gift, but in government there are no free rooms.  The new ballroom will be maintained by federal hands, powered by federal energy, and secured by federal personnel.  That makes it public property with public cost.  Oversight is not obstruction. It is accountability for the long-term cost of short-term vanity.

## In Closing
The East Wing has always served daily, practical needs.  It housed the First Lady’s staff, visitor entrance, family theater, floral workspace, correspondence offices, and tour coordination.  The previous building supported all that without issue.  The new structure changes that purpose.  It shifts the East Wing from function to display, from work to ceremony, and turns a once-practical area into a space that will mostly stand empty while taxpayers quietly cover its upkeep.
