## Opening Thought
The oath of office is not a recital, it is a promise. Every member of Congress begins their service by pledging to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Those words were written not for comfort but for courage. They bind the signer not to a president or a party, but to the principles that make this nation free.

## Bottom Line
A representative’s loyalty belongs to the Constitution and the people who entrusted them with power. Political pressure, fear of being “primaried,” or the lure of party favor cannot replace that duty. When personal ambition outweighs public faith, the oath becomes an empty formality, and the republic weakens.

## When fear replaces faith
Too many lawmakers now treat their oath as a ritual, not a responsibility. The threat of losing favor has replaced the fear of betraying the Constitution. Votes are cast to secure positions, not to protect principles. A Congress governed by fear cannot govern for the people.

The Founders understood that ambition must counteract ambition. The branches of government were made co-equal to prevent obedience to any one office or individual. When legislators yield that independence to preserve their careers, they surrender the very strength that defines their role.

## End Notes
1. U.S. Code, Title 5 § 3331 — Oath of Office.  
2. *The Federalist Papers*, No. 51 (Madison), “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”
