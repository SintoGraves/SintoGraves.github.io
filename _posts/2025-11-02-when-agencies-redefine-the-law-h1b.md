## Opening Thought
Every system begins with intent. When Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1990, it imagined a visa that would open America’s doors to the world’s best minds.  The H-1B program became that door, a channel for global skill to meet American opportunity.  Thirty-five years later, the door is still there, but the frame around it is shifting.

## Discussion: What Congress Built
The H-1B visa was not written in isolation. It was part of a broad legislative design to balance business needs, worker protections, and national growth.  Congress debated how to let employers hire specialized talent without displacing domestic labor.  The result was a statute that defined both purpose and limit: a system that welcomed, but also watched.



### Table 1 – H-1B Legislative Framework (1990–2004)

| Year | Law / Event | Key Change | Branch Involved |
|------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1990 | *Immigration Act of 1990* | Created H-1B for specialty occupations; set degree and wage requirements. | Legislative (Congress + President Bush) |
| 1998 | *ACWIA* | Temporarily raised visa cap; added training fees. | Legislative (Congress + President Clinton) |
| 2000 | *AC21* | Allowed extensions beyond 6 years for green-card applicants. | Legislative (Congress + President Clinton) |
| 2004 | *H-1B Visa Reform Act* | Restored 65 000 cap + 20 000 for advanced degrees. | Legislative (Congress + President G. W. Bush) |

**Table 1 Caption:**  
ACWIA = *American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (1998)*;  
AC21 = *American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (2000)*.  
Both were signed by President Bill Clinton and remain key parts of the H-1B statutory foundation.

## From Capitol Hill to DHS Headquarters
After 2001, the Homeland Security Act transferred immigration management from the Department of Justice to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security.  Within it, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) became the body responsible for H-1B petitions.  That administrative shift quietly altered the system’s center of gravity.

At first, DHS used its delegated authority for process improvements: electronic filings, digital lotteries, and background screening.  Over time, however, the boundary between *managing* and *reshaping* began to blur.

### Table 2 – Timeline of Authority

| Period | Primary Decision Maker | Nature of Change | Effect on Balance of Power |
|---------|-----------------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| 1952–2002 | Congress + INS | Statutory lawmaking; administrative processing. | Legislative dominance |
| 2003–2015 | DHS / USCIS | Modernization and security integration. | Shared authority |
| 2016–2025 | DHS Executive Actions | Fee rules and eligibility redefinitions. | Executive dominance |

**Table 2 Caption:**  
INS = *Immigration and Naturalization Service* (pre-2003 agency under the Department of Justice).  
DHS = *Department of Homeland Security*;  
USCIS = *U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services*, the DHS sub-agency that now administers H-1B petitions.

## The Policy in Practice
Congress authorized reasonable filing fees to recover processing costs.  It did not authorize deterrent pricing.  A processing fee funds the system. A deterrent fee influences behavior.  One implements the law; the other reshapes it.  Supporters argue that a high fee limits misuse of the program and encourages domestic hiring.  Critics say it effectively rewrites congressional intent by turning access into privilege.  

### Table 3 – Framework vs 2025 Actions

| Policy Area | Congressional Intent | 2025 Action | Alignment | Comment |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Purpose | Recruit global talent | Restrict foreign hiring | ⚠️ Partial | Changes goal from growth to protection |
| Fee Structure | Cost recovery | $100 000 deterrent fee | ❌ No | Not authorized by statute |
| Lottery | Random and neutral | Digital update | ✅ Yes | Administrative improvement |
| Oversight | Congressional hearings and caps | Executive orders and agency rules | ⚠️ Weak | Less transparency to public debate |

## The Broader Implication
When executive agencies set policies that alter economic outcomes, they tread into legislative ground.  The Constitution expects Congress to make the law and the Executive to enforce it.  Yet, as administrative power grows, oversight often trails behind.

The H-1B story reflects a larger question: how far can administration go before it becomes legislation in disguise?

---

## In Closing
The H-1B visa began as an idea of cooperation between two branches.  Today, it stands at the edge of interpretation.  The framework Congress built still exists, but the meaning within it is being rewritten, rule by rule, form by form. 
  
 *Do process changes strengthen the law, or slowly replace it?*
