## **Bottom Line**

“Bipartisan” is one of the most overused words in Washington.  
It should mean government working across party lines for the public good.  
In practice, it often means one token vote from the other side.  
Understanding that difference is key to judging how Congress actually governs, not how it advertises.

## **Bipartisan Defined**

Across leading dictionaries, the word *bipartisan* carries the same core meaning — cooperation between opposing political camps.  

- **Merriam-Webster** calls it *“marked by or involving cooperation, agreement, and compromise between two major political parties.”*  
- **Oxford English Dictionary** defines it as *“representing, supported by, or composed of two political parties, especially the two major parties in a two-party system.”*  
- **Collins Dictionary** frames it as *“concerning or involving two different political parties or groups.”*  

Taken together, the term implies **shared participation and joint responsibility**, not merely symbolic support.  
It was coined in the early twentieth century to describe genuine collaboration across party lines — a spirit that today survives more in definition than in practice.

## **Bipartisan in Practice**

True bipartisanship is measured in **numbers and intent**, not labels.  
A bill earns that title when a **meaningful share** of both parties helps shape it and votes to pass it.  
Infrastructure and emergency-relief bills often reach that mark because their benefits are broad and visible.  
Major tax, health, or budget reconciliation bills rarely do, because they cut to ideological roots.  

Over the last decade, Congress has shown a clear pattern:

- **Infrastructure and crisis bills** draw wide majorities from both sides.  
- **Budget resolutions and social-policy overhauls** pass by the slimmest margins.  
- **Continuing Resolutions (CRs)** swing between the two, bipartisan only when a shutdown is hours away.  

The 2026 CR proved it. Republicans passed it 217 – 212 with a single Democrat crossing over.  
Technically bipartisan, but practically partisan.  
That has become Washington’s new normal.

## **Congress Predictability**

History can now predict behavior better than party slogans can.  
Using voting data from the past ten years, patterns emerge:

- When **government is unified**, the ruling party passes more bills on its own.  
- When **government is divided**, the success rate on party-unity votes drops, but cooperation rarely fills the gap.  
- Bipartisan peaks occur only during **national crises** or when **election years force visible results**.  

By measuring cosponsorship, timing, procedure, and polarization, analysts can forecast how a bill will fare before it reaches the floor.  
The model is simple: if a bill is must-pass, deadline-driven, and low on ideology, expect votes from both sides.  
If it rewrites taxes, spending, or social policy, expect a split.  
Congress behaves less like a deliberative body and more like a weather pattern — predictable, seasonal, and self-reinforcing.

---

## **Conclusion**

“Bipartisan” has become a brand, not a behavior.  
It is a word that signals unity while masking division.  
Until the House rewards cooperation over control, bipartisanship will remain a checkbox, not a conviction.

## **Is There Still Hope?**

Despite polarization, there are moments when Congress remembers its purpose — to govern for everyone.  
Across the last decade, a handful of bills proved that when the goal is clear and the benefit national, party lines can blur.  
Veterans’ care, postal reform, semiconductor investment, and foreign aid drew enough cross-party support to show that consensus is still possible.  
When leaders choose problems that affect all Americans — not just their base — compromise stops being a weakness and becomes a tool.

| **Bill / Year** | **Purpose** | **House Vote** | **Minority Support** | **Result** |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Postal Service Reform Act (2022)** | Modernized USPS finances | 342 – 92 | 120 Republicans (> 50 %) | Broadly bipartisan |
| **Honoring Our PACT Act (2022)** | Veterans’ toxic-exposure benefits | 342 – 88 | 123 Republicans (> 50 %) | Broadly bipartisan |
| **Ukraine Supplemental (2022)** | Aid for Ukraine defense | 368 – 57 | 149 Republicans (≈ 60 %) | Broadly bipartisan |
| **CHIPS & Science Act (2022)** | Semiconductor investment | 243 – 187 – 1 | 24 Republicans (≈ 11 %) | Narrowly bipartisan |
| **NDAA FY 2024 (2023)** | Defense authorization | 310 – 118 | ≈ 90 Republicans (≈ 30 %) | Broadly bipartisan |
| **Ukraine Security Aid (2024)** | Support for Ukraine / Israel / Taiwan | 311 – 112 | 101 Republicans (≈ 45 %) | Broadly bipartisan |

These examples do not erase division, but they remind the country that cooperation is not extinct.  
The question is whether lawmakers will treat such votes as rare exceptions — or as the baseline for how a republic should operate.
